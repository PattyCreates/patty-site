				The first time I had a <em>'aha!'</em> moment in respect to my artistic ability was when I was four years old and drew a spitting image of Donald Duck <em>(pun intended, oh yes!)</em>. Later in life, I worked at Disneyland working as a portrait artist. This served as a loose fundraiser for my art schooling.

				Here are 2 facts that led to my passion project: (1) San Francisco has more pets than children and (2) I absolutely love dogs. So in a stroke of brilliance at midnight, I thought â€” <em>how about I commission pet portraits?</em>

				So, that's what I did for a while. Unfortunately, I am currently away from San Francisco, so this project is as well. However, you can view some past pieces on <a href="http://instagram.com/sfpetproject" target="_blank">SF Pet Project's Instagram.</a>

				From crocheting to ceramics to jewelry, I frankly love making things. I accredit the knack to my ADHD and my cheapness: <em>Oh, that's expensive, I can just make that for way cheaper.</em> But in all honesty, all of it is for the love of living that sweet ole hobby retired lifestyle.
