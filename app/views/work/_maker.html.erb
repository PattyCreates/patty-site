			<p>
				In late 2014, I decided my Ikea expedite shelf needed some custom drawers. So, I decided to build some crates. I cut my own wood down at the loveliest of hackerspaces, <%= link_to "Noisebridge", "https://www.noisebridge.net/", target: "_blank" %>. I then assembled the crates at my house. This was my first time using a saw, and I am pretty proud of the results.

				I couldn't be prouder of any other hashtag at this point in life. Huge thanks to Jeffrey Applesauce, Nick Chmura and the kind folks at Noisebridge for letting us borrow their tools and workspace.
