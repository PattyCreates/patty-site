				From crocheting to ceramics to jewelry, I frankly just love making things. I accredit the knack to my ADHD and my cheapness: <em>Oh, that's expensive, I can just make that for way cheaper.</em> But in all honesty, all of it is for the love of living that sweet ole hobby retired lifestyle. Below is a random collection of things I've made.

				In late 2014, I decided my Ikea expedite shelf needed some custom drawers. So, I decided to build some crates. I cut some scrap wood down at the loveliest of hackerspaces, <%= link_to "Noisebridge", "https://www.noisebridge.net/", target: "_blank" %>. I then assembled the crates at my house. This was my first time using a saw, and, yes, there was a minor injury. But all in all, my Ikea shelf now has crates.
