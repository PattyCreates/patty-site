				Appcelerator has two main products: an enterprise MBaaS solution serving over 70% of the Fortune 100 called the Appcelerator Platform and a Javascript to native code compiler called Titanium with an open source developer community of 780,000.

				I joined the Appcelerator team during the exciting <%= link_to "Singly acquisition", "http://venturebeat.com/2013/08/22/why-did-appcelerator-buy-singly-because-it-wants-to-be-the-next-oracle/", target: "_blank" %>. During that time, Appcelerator was focused on selling an enterprise platform consisting of three products: <em>Apps</em>, <em>Analytics</em>, and <em>APIs</em>. My new director was interested in bringing life into the company, so I, heavily influenced by Parse and Urban Airship, spent a healthy amount of time redefining the brand which ultimately resulted in the trifecta emblem for the platform.

				The enblem stood for each pillar of the platform. I was responsible for communicating the solution for the marketing team across several mediums, including: marketing website, whitepapers, microsites, infographics, and assets for email campaigns. Below are screenshots of the website that encompasses the new brand direction I developed.

				Titanium for Developers

			<p>
				The <em>Apps</em> portion of the enterprise platform is specific to Titanium, a compiler of JS to native mobile languages. Titans, loyal developers and evangelists, are Appcelerator’s true bread and butter. Here’s a snippet of an infographic I designed that celebrated the 500,000th developer who joined the community. <%= link_to "See full infographic here.", "http://www.appcelerator.com/500k/", target: "_blank" %>
