					In a nutshell.
				</h2>
				<p>
					As a refugee from Orange County, I have settled into an apartment on a hill in San Francisco, <em>not in an actual nutshell</em>. I'm a visual designer who codes a little bit. I gravitate towards creative strategy, UI/UX, branding, front end coding, DIY, art and puppies.

				<h5>Design Ethos</h5>
				<p>
					I always have the end user in mind and talk to users to receive criticism and validation. Expand as much as possible during brainstorming and edit out all unneccesary elements afterward.
